Policy</b><br>

<sup><i>Last
Updated: May 9, 2016</i></sup><br><br>
















Your privacy is very
important to RadicalMedia LLC (“Radical,” “we” or “us”).&nbsp;
In order to best protect your information, we have adopted this privacy
policy (“Privacy Policy”), which applies to any and all information about you
that we collect.&nbsp; It is important to note
that this Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through www.radicalmedia.com
and related websites that we own and control (the “Website”).&nbsp; Therefore, if you click any links on the Website
that lead to websites owned or operated by third parties or if you access any
other website, this Privacy Policy no longer applies.&nbsp; You should review the privacy policies adopted
by those third parties to ensure that you know what information is being
collected and for what it is being used.&nbsp;
Also note that the Website is not directed at children under the age of
18 years.&nbsp; <br><br>

<b>What Information We Collect and How We
Collect It</b><br>

Some of the
information we collect is Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”).&nbsp; PII, collected only with your consent,
includes your email address and any other information that you provide to us
that is linked to your identity.&nbsp; We will
only collect PII that is relevant to the services that we provide and the
maintenance of the Website.&nbsp; This may
occur, for example, when you communicate with us through our Website or by phone,
mail or email.&nbsp; Remember that you always
have the option not to provide information by choosing not to use the Website or
by not using the particular feature of the Website for which the information is
being collected.<br><br>

We currently do not
use “cookies,” but we reserve the right to begin to use them at any time.&nbsp; Cookies are small pieces data that are stored
on your computer by your browser.&nbsp; This
data helps our Website manage your experience while you visit and helps us
determine whether you are a first-time visitor.&nbsp;
You can always tell your Internet browser that you don’t want to have
any cookies downloaded to your computer.&nbsp;
Check with the provider of your particular browser to find out how.&nbsp; Before you do however, note that deleting
cookies or directing your browser to refuse them may limit your ability to use
certain portions of our Website that require cookies to function.&nbsp; Lastly, third parties who partner with us to
display advertising, if we have any, may also use cookies to collect or store
data.<br><br>

We may also collect
non-personally identifying information.&nbsp;
As an example, we may collect information as visitors browse our Website
such as the number of people that visit, what pages are visited and from where
visitors come (like Google or Bing).&nbsp; We
may also compile this data to enable statistical analysis of our services that
would be used internally or with external assistance to make improvements to
our Website.&nbsp; We may also provide this
information to third parties, including advertisers. &nbsp;Remember though that this information is not
personally identifiable.<br><br>

<b>California Do Not Track Procedures </b><br>

We respect your choices
about what PII we collect and what PII third parties can collect through
us.&nbsp; Therefore, if we ever begin to use
any tracking technology, we will follow any Do-Not-Track instructions from your
browser and any other direction that you give us regarding collection and
dissemination of PII.&nbsp; Note however that
any Do-Not-Track or similar mechanism will not affect our collection of the
data that you voluntarily provide to us, as detailed above.&nbsp; So, please do not provide us with any
information that you do not want collected.&nbsp;
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Website who
are California residents to request certain information regarding disclosure of
their personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. We
do not make any such disclosures, however, if you would like to make such a
request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:websitesupport@radicalmedia.com" target="">websitesupport@radicalmedia.com</a>.<br><br>

<b>Children’s Privacy</b><br>

The privacy of
children is of the utmost importance, and we are committed to complying with
the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly
collect, use, or disclose PII from children under the age of 13.&nbsp; If we ever discover that we have
inadvertently collected PII from children under the age of 13, we will delete
it as soon as possible.&nbsp; If you are a
parent or legal guardian, and believe that we have collected PII from your
child under the age of 13, please email us at <a href="mailto:websitesupport@radicalmedia.com" target="">websitesupport@radicalmedia.com</a>,
and we will take steps to delete this PII as soon as possible.<br><br>

<b>Our Use of Information</b><br>

We may use the information we collect for a number of
purposes.&nbsp; For instance we may use it to
respond to your inquiries and otherwise correspond with you, to process
transactions<b> </b>that you request, to
maintain the security and integrity of our Website and services, and for the
administration, review and improvement of the content of our Website and services.&nbsp; We may also use your information to provide
you with Radical updates that we think may interest you.&nbsp; However, we will always give you the
opportunity to opt out of receiving such communications as well as any
newsletter for which you sign up.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
















<b>Our Policy for Disclosing Your
Information to Third Parties</b><br>

Again, your privacy
is important to us and as a result we are protective of your information.&nbsp; Except as stated above, there are only three
instances in which we will disclose any of your information to anyone but you,
as follows:<br><br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To our service
providers.&nbsp; We may disclose your
information to third parties who provide services to us, such as our database
management vendors.<br><br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If we are
acquired by another company.&nbsp; If another
company acquires Radical or our assets, that company will take on all
responsibility for the personal information we collect and it will assume all
rights and obligations with respect to that information.&nbsp; This may also happen if Radical ever enters
bankruptcy proceedings.&nbsp; Should any of
this happen, the acquiring company may develop its own policy with respect to
your information.<br><br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If we are
required to disclose information by law.&nbsp;
When directed by a court of law or other government entity, if we have a
good faith basis to believe disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, or
if we feel it necessary in order to prevent illegal, unethical or legally
actionable conduct, we may be obligated to disclose personal information.&nbsp; In such event, we will comply with the law
and make commercially reasonable efforts to notify you, if legal. <br><br>

We do not sell or
distribute PII to any third parties except as set forth above.&nbsp;<br/><br><b>Access to Your Information</b><br>

We will provide you with
access to PII you provide us for as long as we maintain that information in a
readily accessible format. We will also work with you to correct any error in
your PII.&nbsp; If you wish to access or
correct any PII that you have submitted through our Website, or to have us
completely remove your PII from our systems, please send an e-mail with your
specific request to <a href="mailto:websitesupport@radicalmedia.com" target="">websitesupport@radicalmedia.com</a>.&nbsp; <br><br>

<b>Security</b><br>

We have in place
physical, administrative and electronic safeguards to keep your information
safe.&nbsp; For instance, we only allow access
to employees who require your information to do their jobs and we use industry
standard SSL encryption to secure your data. <br><br>

<b>Changes to the Privacy Policy</b><br>

We may make changes
to this Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp;
If we do, we’ll be sure to try to notify you at the email address you
have provided us, if any, and to post the date of the latest revision herein.<br><br>

If you have questions about our Privacy Policy please
contact us at <a href="mailto:websitesupport@radicalmedia.com" target="">websitesupport@radicalmedia.com</a>.&nbsp; <br></div>
